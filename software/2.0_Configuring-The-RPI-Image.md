# Set up the software

## Introduction

![balena-etcher-app](/images/balena-etcher-app.png)

## Overview
For setting up the software the quickest way is to use the Raspberry Pi Imager or Balena etcher.

You can either use the [custom rpi image]() with all the dependencies pre-installed or you can install the dependencies manually starting from the [base image](https://downloads.raspberrypi.com/raspios_lite_armhf/images/raspios_lite_armhf-2024-03-15/2024-03-15-raspios-bookworm-armhf-lite.img.xz). 

I recommend those who are new to the Raspberry Pi to use the custom image, as it will save you time and effort, and those with experience and want to apply their own pi projects to use the base image.


## Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need the following at hand:
- A Raspberry Pi Zero (or Zero W, Zero 2 W) with an SD card
- A computer with an SD card reader
- A micro USB power supply
- Rpi Zero 2 W or Zero W:
- Rpi camera module or USB webcam
  
> Note that Raspberry Pi Zero W/Zero 2 W have built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, so you can configure your network wirelessly before you start the project. If you are using the Raspberry Pi Zero, you will need a USB to Ethernet adapter or a USB Wi-Fi dongle to connect to your network.



## Installing the Raspberry Pi OS Lite image
 I utilized the Raspberry Pi Imager to flash the Raspberry Pi OS Lite image onto the SD card. The Raspberry Pi Imager is a simple tool that allows you to select the operating system you want to install, the SD card you want to install it on, and then flash the image onto the SD card.

  The Raspberry Pi OS Lite version is also smaller in size, which is beneficial for the Raspberry Pi Zero, which has limited storage space. You can download the Raspberry Pi OS Lite image from the Raspberry Pi website at the following link: [Raspberry Pi OS Lite](https://downloads.raspberrypi.com/raspios_lite_armhf/images/)

It has been tested with OS Lite versions:
- 2024-03-15
- 2023-02-21

You can download the custom image via the following link: [Custom Image Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15d4UIy0p0slFVZiWBizcbEO5UDwecwEo?usp=drive_link)

Once you have downloaded the standard Raspberry Pi OS Lite image, or the custom image, you can use the balena Etcher application to flash the image onto the SD card. The balena Etcher is a simple tool that allows you to select the image you want to install, the SD card you want to install it on, and then flash the image onto the SD card.
## Step 1: Download Balena Etcher or Raspberry Pi Imager

The first step is to download the balena Etcher application from the balena website. The balena Etcher is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download the balena Etcher from the balena website at the following link: [balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
Alternatively, you can download the Raspberry Pi Imager from the Raspberry Pi website. The Raspberry Pi Imager is available for Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu. You can download the Raspberry Pi Imager from the Raspberry Pi website at the following link: [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/)

## Step 2: Install the Imager on your Computer
Once you have downloaded the Raspberry Pi Imager, you can install it on your computer. The installation process is straightforward, and you can follow the on-screen instructions to install the Raspberry Pi Imager on your computer.

## Step 3: Flash the Raspberry Pi OS Lite image
Once you have installed the Raspberry Pi Imager, you can use it to flash the Raspberry Pi OS Lite image onto the SD card. To do this, follow these steps for using the rpi imager:

![balena-etcher-app](/images/rpi-imager-1.gif)
1. Insert the SD card into your computer.
2. Open the Raspberry Pi Imager.
3. Click on "Choose OS" and select "Raspberry Pi OS (other)".
4. Click on "Choose SD Card" and select the SD card you want to install the Raspberry Pi OS Lite image on.
5. Click on "Write" to flash the Raspberry Pi OS Lite image onto the SD card.
6. Once the flashing process is complete, remove the SD card from your computer.
7. Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi Zero.
8. Power on the Raspberry Pi Zero.

## Step 4: Set up the Raspberry Pi Zero and log in
Plug in your external keyboard and connect the Raspberry Pi Zero to a monitor using a HDMI cable. You can also connect the Raspberry Pi Zero to your network using a USB to Ethernet adapter or a USB Wi-Fi dongle. The Zero W and Zero 2 W have built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, so you can connect to your network wirelessly.
Here are the steps to set up the Raspberry Pi Zero and log in:
1.  Log in with the default username and password (unless otherwise configured on rpi-imager). The default username is "pi" and the default password is "raspberry" (unless otherwise configured).
2.  Change the default password by running the following command:
```bash
passwd
```
3. Enter the current password ("raspberry") and then enter a new password. You will be prompted to enter the new password again to confirm it.
4.  Set the hostname of the Raspberry Pi Zero by running the following command:
```bash
sudo raspi-config
```
5.  Select `System Options` and then `Hostname` to set the hostname of the Raspberry Pi Zero. You can set the hostname to any name you like. Save the changes and exit the raspi-config tool.
6.  Reboot the Raspberry Pi Zero by running the following command:
```bash
sudo reboot
```
7.  Log in with the new password.

## Step 5: Update the OS and install OS dependencies

1. First, you need to update the package list and upgrade the packages on your Raspberry Pi Zero/Zero W/Zero 2. If you have not already done so, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
2. Next, you can set up the Wi-Fi connection through the raspi-config tool. You can do this by running the following command:


```bash
sudo raspi-config
```
Select `System Options` and then `Wireless LAN` to set up the Wi-Fi connection. You can also set up the Wi-Fi connection by editing the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```
Add the following lines to the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file:

```bash
network={
    ssid="
    psk="
}
```
Replace `ssid` with the name of your Wi-Fi network and `psk` with the password of your Wi-Fi network. Save the file and exit the editor.


  
1. Next, you need to enable the camera on your Raspberry Pi Zero/Zero W/Zero 2. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

Select `Interfacing Options` and then `Camera` and enable the camera. Reboot the Raspberry Pi Zero after enabling the camera.
4. (Optional) You can also enable SSH on your Raspberry Pi Zero/Zero W/Zero 2. SSH is disabled by default on the Raspberry Pi OS Lite image. To enable SSH, run the following command:

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```
Select `Interfacing Options` and then `SSH` and enable SSH. Reboot the Raspberry Pi Zero after enabling SSH.

> Note: You can also connect to the Raspberry Pi Zero using a USB to Ethernet adapter or a USB Wi-Fi dongle if you don't have the zero W or zero 2 W models.

For more information on setting up the Raspberry Pi Zero, see the [Raspberry Pi Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/).
