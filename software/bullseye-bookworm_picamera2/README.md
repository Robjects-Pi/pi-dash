# Camera Module on Bullseye and Bookworm
With bullseye and bookworm, the camera module is enabled by default. You can use the camera module without having to enable it in the raspi-config tool.

>Note:
Keep in mind that the camera is not supported on bullseye if you disable the camera interface in the raspi-config tool.
If you disable the camera interface, you will need to re-enable it to use the camera scripts and files in this directory

See [3.0_Software-Configuring-and-Testing.md](python/record_10_secs/3.0_Software-Configuring-and-Testing.md) for more information on how to configure and test the camera module on bullseye and bookworm.
