Below is a setup script named `setup.sh` that you can use to set up a Raspberry Pi Zero to run Picamera2 within a Python virtual environment. This script assumes you are starting from a fresh boot with a standard Raspberry Pi OS installation.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update and upgrade the system
echo "Updating and upgrading the system..."
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Python3 and pip if they are not installed
echo "Installing Python3 and pip..."
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install virtualenv for creating virtual environments
echo "Installing virtualenv..."
sudo apt install python3-venv

# Create a virtual environment for Picamera2
echo "Creating a virtual environment for Picamera2..."
python3 -m venv picamera2_env

# Activate the virtual environment
echo "Activating the virtual environment..."
source picamera2_env/bin/activate

# Install Picamera2 and its dependencies
echo "Installing Picamera2 and its dependencies..."
pip install picamera2

# Install additional dependencies if needed
echo "Installing additional dependencies..."
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev libopenjp2-7 libtiff5 -y

# Deactivate the virtual environment
echo "Deactivating the virtual environment..."
deactivate

echo "Setup complete. You can now use Picamera2 by activating the virtual environment with 'source picamera2_env/bin/activate'."
```

### Explanation of the Script

1. **System Update and Upgrade**: The script starts by updating the package lists for upgrades of packages that need upgrading as well as new packages that have just come to the repositories.

2. **Python and pip Installation**: It ensures that Python3 and pip are installed. These are essential for creating a virtual environment and installing Python packages.

3. **Virtual Environment Setup**: The script installs `virtualenv`, a tool to create isolated Python environments, and then creates a new virtual environment named `picamera2_env`.

4. **Activate Virtual Environment**: Before installing any packages specific to the project, the script activates the virtual environment.

5. **Install Picamera2**: Installs the `picamera2` library, which is the main library required for interfacing with the Raspberry Pi camera in newer setups.

6. **Install Additional Dependencies**: Installs additional packages that might be required by Picamera2 for full functionality.

7. **Deactivate Virtual Environment**: Finally, the script deactivates the virtual environment. You can activate it again anytime using the source command shown at the end of the script.

### Usage

To use this script:

1. Save the script as `setup.sh` on your Raspberry Pi Zero.
2. Make the script executable with the command `chmod +x setup.sh`.
3. Run the script using `./setup.sh`.

This script will set up everything needed to start working with Picamera2 in a clean and organized environment.
