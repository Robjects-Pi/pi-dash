# Set up the software

## Introduction

## Overview
For setting up the software the quickest way is to use the Raspberry Pi Imager or Balena etcher.

If you already have the Raspberry Pi OS installed on your SD card, you can skip this step and proceed to the next step. 

 This is a tool that allows you to install the Raspberry Pi OS on your SD card. The Raspberry Pi OS is a Debian-based operating system that is specifically designed for the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi Imager is available for Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu. I will be using the Raspberry Pi OS Lite version, which is a minimal version of the Raspberry Pi OS that does not include the desktop environment.


 This is ideal for the Pi-Dash project as it will not be using a monitor or keyboard. The Raspberry Pi OS Lite version is also smaller in size, which is beneficial for the Raspberry Pi Zero, which has limited storage space. 

 I utilized the Raspberry Pi Imager to flash the Raspberry Pi OS Lite image onto the SD card. The Raspberry Pi Imager is a simple tool that allows you to select the operating system you want to install, the SD card you want to install it on, and then flash the image onto the SD card.

## Step 1: Download BalenaEtcher orRaspberry Pi Imager
The first step is to download the balena Etcher application from the balena website. The balena Etcher is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download the balena Etcher from the balena website at the following link: [balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
Alternatively, you can download the Raspberry Pi Imager from the Raspberry Pi website. The Raspberry Pi Imager is available for Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu. You can download the Raspberry Pi Imager from the Raspberry Pi website at the following link: [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/)

## Step 2: Install the Imager on your omputer
Once you have downloaded the Raspberry Pi Imager, you can install it on your computer. The installation process is straightforward, and you can follow the on-screen instructions to install the Raspberry Pi Imager on your computer.

## Step 3: Flash the Raspberry Pi OS Lite image
Once you have installed the Raspberry Pi Imager, you can use it to flash the Raspberry Pi OS Lite image onto the SD card. To do this, follow these steps for using the rpi imager:

![balena-etcher-app](/images/rpi-imager-1.gif)
1. Insert the SD card into your computer.
2. Open the Raspberry Pi Imager.
3. Click on "Choose OS" and select "Raspberry Pi OS (other)".
4. Click on "Choose SD Card" and select the SD card you want to install the Raspberry Pi OS Lite image on.
5. Click on "Write" to flash the Raspberry Pi OS Lite image onto the SD card.
6. Once the flashing process is complete, remove the SD card from your computer.
7. Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi Zero.
8. Power on the Raspberry Pi Zero.

## Step 4: Set up the Raspberry Pi Zero
9.  The Raspberry Pi Zero will boot up and you will be prompted to log in.
10. Log in with the default username and password. The default username is "pi" and the default password is "raspberry" (unless otherwise configured).
11. Once you have logged in, you can configure the Raspberry Pi Zero using the `raspi-config` tool.
12. You can now proceed to install the dependencies and updates required for the Pi-Dash project.

## Step 5: Clone the Repository
1. First, you need to clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi Zero. To do this, open a terminal window on the Raspberry Pi Zero and run the following command in whatever directory you want to clone the repository to:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Robjects-Pi/Pi-Dash.git
```

2. This will clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi Zero. You can now navigate to the `Pi-Dash` directory by running the following command:

```bash
cd Pi-Dash
```

## Step 6: Create a backup of the SD card
13. Once you have set up the Raspberry Pi Zero, you can create a backup of the SD card. This is useful in case anything goes wrong with the Raspberry Pi Zero and you need to restore it to its original state. You can create a backup of the SD card using the Raspberry Pi Imager. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Insert the SD card into your computer
2. 
## Step 6: Install the dependencies and updates
1.  First, update the current os to the latest version:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

2. Next, you can install the dependencies required for the Pi-Dash project by running the following commands:




3.  You can also install the dependencies required for the Pi-Dash project by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip


13. You can also proceed to install the Python code that makes the Pi-Dash project function.
14. You can now proceed to set up the hardware for the Pi-Dash project.






and then load the Python code that makes the code function. The Software & OS section outlines the process in full, starting with setting up the Raspberry Pi Zero, flashing the SD card and installing the depedencies and updates to your machine.
