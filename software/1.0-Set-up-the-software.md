## Overview
For setting up the software the quickest way is to use the Raspberry Pi Imager or Balena etcher. This is a tool that allows you to install the Raspberry Pi OS on your SD card. The Raspberry Pi OS is a Debian-based operating system that is specifically designed for the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi Imager is available for Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu. I will be using the Raspberry Pi OS Lite version, which is a minimal version of the Raspberry Pi OS that does not include the desktop environment.


 This is ideal for the Alto project as it will not be using a monitor or keyboard. The Raspberry Pi OS Lite version is also smaller in size, which is beneficial for the Raspberry Pi Zero, which has limited storage space.







and then load the Python code that makes the code function. The Software & OS section outlines the process in full, starting with setting up the Raspberry Pi Zero, flashing the SD card and installing the depedencies and updates to your machine.
