## Setting up from scratch (advanced)

It’s recommended to use the SD card image if you are setting up this project for the first time, especially if you are not making any changes to its behavior or want to expand off of the examples given. It will definitely save you a lot of hassle and time trying to adapt the camera dependencies and libraries in other Raspberry Pi versions as they are known to change dramatically in the operation of cameras across OS versions. This guide is included to give you an overview of the technical underpinnings of combining python with bash scripts and services executed by the Operating system which you can refer to if you wish to modify its code or incorporate your own unique features.<br>

### About the system

At the DIY Dashboard heart is a Raspberry Pi Zero that will be performing the logic and continuous recordings when the computer starts up. It’s responsible for interfacing with the user’s connected camera module (connected via cable). The OS starts automatically, and does its usual bootup related to the rpi lite initialization. So in order to start recordings as soon as possible, we utilize the system's service to start the python files that 
begin the recordings, set to a pre-determined time we want the recordings to be in. For example, you might want to break up recordings to a very small duration in case you potentially want to use the recordings in data science applications since are limited in the amount of processing it can perform on larger sized data. Or, if you are just hoping to record larger size durations, with the addition of a large sized memory card or attached usb, you might want to record 5 minutes, with the least amount of gaps as you plan to only use the data whenever the need arises.

Thus, I have created a setup script that allows you easily change the duration of each video clip taken. Keep in mind that if you don't plan on adding an extra battery, it is very possible you lose the last clip that the camera records, which if you created a long duration, could end up being very unfortunate if you turn off your car, or worse... your car turns off due to a wreck or accident.


#### Install manually

1. From a freshly flashed image, install the OS dependencies
```
$ sudo apt-get update
#$ sudo apt-get install -y git python3-picamera python3-pigpio python3-rpi.gpio
```

2. Enable the camera
```
$ sudo raspi-config
```

3. TODO

4. Enable TODO
```
$ sudo systemctl enable pigpiod
$ TODO
```

5. Install the ETODO
```
$TODO
$ sudo bash install.sh
$ cd ..
```


6. Run the app
```
$ cd 
$ python3 record.py
```
