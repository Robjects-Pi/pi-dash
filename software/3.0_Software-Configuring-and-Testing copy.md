This section will guide you through the process of configuring and testing the software for the DIY Dashboard project. The software is responsible for recording videos using the Raspberry Pi Zero and camera module. The software is written in Python and uses the `picamera` library to interface with the camera module.

The software is designed to be simple and easy to use, and is aimed at beginners and hobbyists who are interested in learning about DIY applications. The software is designed to be flexible and customizable, so you can easily modify it to suit your needs.

Included in this section are instructions on how to:
1. Configure the software from the repository
2. Start recording videos with a sample script
3. explanation of the code, variables, and python modules
4. Explanation of how automatic recording is enabled
5. Script to enable automatic recording on boot

The software is designed to be easy to use, so you can start recording videos with the Raspberry Pi Zero in no time. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
1. First, you need to clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi Zero. To do this, plug in your external keyboard and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Robjects-Pi/Pi-Dash.git
```
This will clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi Zero. You can now navigate to the `Pi-Dash` directory by running the following command:

>Note: If you do not have Git installed on your Raspberry Pi Zero, you can install it by running the following command:
`sudo apt-get install git`
>

## Step 2: Configure the Software
1. Next, you need to configure the software for the DIY Dashboard project. Change to the `software` directory by running the following command:

```bash
cd Pi-Dash/software
```

2. Run the setup script to configure the software. The setup script will install the required dependencies and set up the software for the DIY Dashboard project. To run the setup script, run the following command:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The setup script will install the required dependencies and set up the software for the DIY Dashboard project. You can now start recording videos with the Raspberry Pi Zero.

## Step 3: Start Recording Videos
1. Change to the `software` directory by running the following command:

```bash
cd Pi-Dash/software
```

2. Run the record script to start recording videos. The script will start recording and save the video files in the `videos` directory. The script will run until you stop it by pressing `Ctrl+C`. To run the script, run the following command:

```bash
python3 record.py
```

The script will start recording videos with the Raspberry Pi Zero. You can now start recording videos with the Raspberry Pi Zero.

## Step 4: Explanation of the Code
The code for the DIY Dashboard project is written in Python and uses the `picamera` library to interface with the camera module. The code is designed to be simple and easy to understand, so you can easily modify it to suit your needs.

The code is divided into two main parts: the `record.py` script and the `record.service` script. The `record.py` script is responsible for starting and stopping the recording of videos, while the `record.service` script is responsible for starting the `record.py` script on boot.

The `record.py` script uses the `picamera` library to interface with the camera module. The script starts recording videos when it is run and saves the video files in the `videos` directory. The script runs until you stop it by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

The `record.service` script is a systemd service that starts the `record.py` script on boot. The service is configured to start the `record.py` script when the Raspberry Pi Zero boots up, so you can start recording videos automatically when the Raspberry Pi Zero starts up.

## Step 5: Enable Automatic Recording on Boot
1. Copy the `record.service` file to the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory by running the following command:

```bash
sudo cp record.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

2. Reload the systemd manager configuration by running the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

3. Enable the service to start on boot by running the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable record.service
```

4. Start the service by running the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start record.service
```

5. Check the status of the service by running the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl status record.service
```

The service should be running and the camera should be recording. The video files will be saved in the `videos` directory.

6. To stop the service, run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop record.service
```

7. To disable the service from starting on boot, run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable record.service
```

8. To remove the service, run the following command:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/record.service
```

The software is now configured and you can start recording videos with the Raspberry Pi Zero. The videos will be saved in the `videos` directory and you can access them at any time.

## Additional functionality
I have included additional scripts in the `extra-features` directory that you can use to test the functionality of the camera module. The scripts include:
- `detect_power_loss.py`: A script that detects when the power is lost and shuts down the Raspberry Pi Zero safely using a battery backup. This script is useful for preventing data corruption when the power is lost, and for ensuring that the Raspberry Pi Zero shuts down safely.
- `send_to_server.py`: A script that sends video files to a online server. You can possibly use this in combination with the previous script to send the video files to a server when the power is lost. This script is useful for backing up your video files and for accessing them remotely.
- `sync_to_usb.py`: A script that syncs video files to an external USB drive. This script is useful for backing up your video files and for accessing them remotely.
- `offline_sync_to_server.py`: A script that syncs video files to a server or external USB drive when the Raspberry Pi Zero is offline. This script is useful for backing up your video files and for accessing them remotely.
- `offline_sync_to_server.sh`: A bash script that syncs video files to a server or external USB drive when the Raspberry Pi Zero is offline. This script is useful for backing up your video files and for accessing them remotely.
- `offline_sync_to_server.service`: A systemd service that syncs video files to a server or external USB drive when the Raspberry Pi Zero is offline. This script is useful for backing up your video files and for accessing them remotely.
- `LED.py`: A script that controls an LED connected to the Raspberry Pi Zero. This script is useful for indicating the status of the Raspberry Pi Zero, such as when it is recording or when the power is lost.

## Conclusion
Now that you have configured the software for the DIY Dashboard project, you can start working on the assembly of the project. The next section will guide you through the process of printing the case for all your components. Let's get started!
