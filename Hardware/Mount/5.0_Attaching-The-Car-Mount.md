# Printing the case for all your components

This section will guide you through the process of printing the case for the Pi-Dash project. The case is designed to house all the components of the Pi-Dash project, including the Raspberry Pi Zero, the camera module, and the power supply. The case is designed to be compact and easy to assemble, making it ideal for use in a car or other small spaces.


Keep in mind that some cars can get very hot! Make sure to test the case in a hot environment to ensure that it can withstand the heat. If you are unsure, consider using a heat-resistant material or adding ventilation holes to the case, especially if you are using plastic or PLA.
