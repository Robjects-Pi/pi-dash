# Gathering your Case, Mounting Hardware and other necessary items before placing the Raspberry Pi Zero W in the car

## Step 1: Gather your materials

To build the case for your Raspberry Pi Zero W, you will need the following materials:

- A Raspberry Pi Zero W
- A case for the Raspberry Pi Zero W
- A power supply for the Raspberry Pi Zero W
- A microSD card with the Raspberry Pi OS installed
- A USB cable to connect the Raspberry Pi Zero W to the car
- A USB to micro USB adapter to connect the USB cable to the Raspberry Pi Zero W

## Step 2: Assemble the case

To assemble the case for your Raspberry Pi Zero W, follow these steps:

1. Place the Raspberry Pi Zero W in the case.
2. Connect the power supply to the Raspberry Pi Zero W.
3. Connect the microSD card to the Raspberry Pi Zero W.
4. Connect the USB cable to the Raspberry Pi Zero W.
5. Connect the USB to micro USB adapter to the USB cable.
6. 



Keep in mind that some cars can get very hot! Make sure to test the case in a hot environment to ensure that it can with stand the heat or at least the hottest days in your area (it can get up to 60 degrees Celsius in some Texas cars).

 If you are unsure, consider using a heat-resistant material or adding ventilation holes to the case, especially if you are using plastic or PLA.


I used a metal case for my project, but you can use any material you like, such as plastic or wood. The case is designed to be 3D printed, but you can also use a laser cutter or CNC machine to cut the parts out of a sheet of material.
