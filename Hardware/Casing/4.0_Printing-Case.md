# Printing the case for all your components

This section will guide you through the process of printing the case for the Pi-Dash project. The case is designed to house all the components of the Pi-Dash project, including the Raspberry Pi Zero, the camera module, and the power supply. The case is designed to be compact and easy to assemble, making it ideal for use in a car or other small spaces.


Keep in mind that some cars can get very hot! Make sure to test the case in a hot environment to ensure that it can withstand the heat. If you are unsure, consider using a heat-resistant material or adding ventilation holes to the case, especially if you are using plastic or PLA.




### Hacking the [casing]()
The casing for Alto can easily be changed to fit whatever application you might have in mind. Whether thatâ€™s simple aesthetic changes to modify Pi-Dash look, or changes to the design to make it more robust or portable, the casing is designed to be easy to modify.

Here are some options for hacking the casing of the project:
- Changing the material of the casing to make it more robust
- Changing the case for high heat environments for long term recording and hotter climates

- Creating a custom design for the casing of a raspberry pi 4 or 3
- Adding a mount to the casing to attach it to a tripod or other device



### Casing

The casing for the pi dash is designed to be easy to 3D print and assemble. It is made up of 3 parts: the top, the bottom, and the middle. The top and bottom are designed to be printed in a flexible material, while the middle is designed to be printed in a rigid material. The top and bottom are held together by screws, while the middle is held in place by the top and bottom. The casing is designed to be easy to assemble and disassemble, so that you can easily access the electronics inside.
