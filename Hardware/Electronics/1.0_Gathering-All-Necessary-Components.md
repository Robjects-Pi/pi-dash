# Gathering all necessary components:
____________________________________

![](/images/overview-pi-dash.jpeg)


Before diving into the code, we need to gather all the necessary components for the Pi-Dash project. This section will guide you through the process of gathering all the necessary components for the Pi-Dash project. The components are divided into two categories:

   1. **Required Pre-built components (w/ affiliate links)**  
   2. ***Extra components (optional) for DIY***

## **Required** pre-built Components (w/ affiliate links)
______________
<!-- TODO: #22 Add overall picture with all REQUIRED components -->

- For the basic setup, you will need the following components (required):
1. [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://amzn.to/3UDAEcy)
2. [Raspberry Pi Camera Module](https://amzn.to/4dB9yf2)
3. [Micro SD Card (128 GB)](https://amzn.to/4byH83w)
4.  [Micro SD Card Reader](https://amzn.to/3JXlxpE) (for flashing the image)
5. A Power Supply options (Recommend at LEAST 10ft long, 5V with at least 2.5 A):
   1. [USB Cable](https://amzn.to/4bw83g7): 11 ft cable for those that already know how and where to place the power supply in the car.
   2. [Car adapter with 11.5 ft cable attached](https://amzn.to/3JX3OyE): usb cable (type-a to micro usb) to power Car Charger the charger adapter to power the device in the car.
   3. [Wall plug power supply](https://amzn.to/3UuUJ4O): Power supply (wall connection to micro usb) to power the device in the house while testing or setting up the device in the car.

6. **Mounting options** (without affiliate links):
Choose one of the following mounting options for the setup of the Raspberry Pi Zero W and the Raspberry Pi Camera Module in the car:


   1. (Recommended) Front Mirror attachment mount (see             [remixing-pi-dash.md](../Mount/5.0_Attaching-The-Car-Mount.md) for more details)
   2.  Suction cup mount (known as a windshield mount)
   3. Adhesive mount
   4. Tripod mount

> Note: If you are going to use any adhesion based products, ensure product is top quality, ESPECIALLY if to stick the car windshield glass as it will be against gravity and could fall off and damage the camera or car.




Those are the basic components you will need to build the Pi-Dash project. Now let's take a look at the DIY components you can add to the project to enhance its functionality.



## EXTRA components (optional) for DIY

Here are some **extra** components (optional) listed by 
- Possible area you want to improve or enhance
- Solution to the problem
- List of components you will need to build the project

<!-- TODO: Add overall picture with specific components -->
**Problem**: Poor audio quality
**Solution**: Add a microphone to the Raspberry Pi Zero to improve audio quality. This will help you record clear audio and improve the quality of the recordings.

    1. Microphone USB Module for Raspberry Pi
    2. Microphone USB adapter
    3. USB Data Transfer Cable for Rpi zero W/2W (type-a to micro usb)

<!-- TODO: Add overall picture with specific components -->
**Problem**: Limited storage capacity
**Solution**: Add a storage device to the Raspberry Pi Zero to increase storage capacity. This will allow you to store more recordings and improve the performance of the Raspberry Pi Zero.

    1. USB Drive
    2. USB Data Transfer Cable
    3. USB Hub
    4. (optional) USB Drive Mount

<!-- TODO: Add overall picture with specific components -->
**Problem**: Limited battery life
**Solution**: Add a battery to the Raspberry Pi Zero to increase battery life. This will allow you to record videos for longer periods of time and improve the performance of the Raspberry Pi Zero.

    1. Battery
    2. Battery Charger
    3. Voltage Regulator
    4. Jumper Wires
    5. (optional) Breadboard
    6. (optional) Battery Mount

<!-- TODO: Add overall picture with specific components -->
**Problem**: For transferring files wirelessly to a server
**Solution**: Add a WiFi adapter to the Raspberry Pi Zero to increase connectivity options. This will allow you to connect to the internet and transfer files wirelessly.

    1. USB WiFi Adapter for Raspberry Pi zero
    2. Wifi extender
    3. (optional) USB WiFi Adapter Mount

<!-- TODO: Add overall picture with specific components -->
**Problem**: Limited display options
**Solution**: Add a monitor to the Raspberry Pi Zero to increase display options. This will allow you to view the recordings and debug the code.

    1. Monitor
    2. HDMI Cable
    3. USB to HDMI Adapter
    4. (optional) Monitor Mount
   

<!-- TODO: Add overall picture with specific components -->
**Problem**: High temperature and overheating
**Solution**: Add a fan to the Raspberry Pi Zero to improve cooling and performance. This will help prevent the Raspberry Pi Zero from overheating and improve its performance.

    1. Fan
    2. Heat Sink
    3. Metal Case
    4. (optional) Fan Mount

<!-- TODO: Add overall picture with specific components -->
**Problem**: Manual recording and manual transfer of videos
**Solution**: Add push buttons and a switch to the Raspberry Pi Zero to manually record and transfer videos offline. This will allow you to manually record videos and transfer them to a storage device without an internet connection.

    1. Push Buttons
    2. Switch
    3. Resistors
    4. Wires
    5. LEDs


**Problem**: For offline transfer of videos once battery is removed from car.with a button to turn off/on(optional)
**Solution**: Add a battery to the Raspberry Pi Zero to transfer videos offline with a button to turn off/on. This will allow you to transfer videos to a storage device without an internet connection and turn off the Raspberry Pi Zero when not in use.

    1. Battery
    2. [Battery Charger](https://amzn.to/4bbtRho)
