Say hello to the world of DIY recording, and introduce yourself to your own DIY dashcam built and ported to a raspberry pi.

A DIY Dashcam using Raspberry Pi Zero W and Pi Camera Module V2.1!


# Overview
The pi dash was designed to simplify data collection, and teach you how to not only code your own recording device from the endless capabilities of a raspberry Pi!  

With this, you will be able to go past the basic functionalities and limits of pre-built dashcams
and integrate your own solutions and features that extensive data collection and recording can provide.

With the tutorial, you will be able to build your own dashcam that **records and stores video files in a location of your preference.** The project is designed to be a simple, easy-to-follow guide to building a DIY dashcam using a Raspberry Pi Zero. The project is aimed at beginners and hobbyists who are interested in learning relevant implementations of DIY applications.

Also, by following this tutorial, you will learn about the basics of machine learning and computer vision, and how to apply these concepts to a real-world project. The project is designed to be a fun and engaging way to learn about these topics, and to inspire you to explore them further.

Now let's take a look at what youâ€™ll find in this repository. Each section has further details on how to build your own Pi-Dash, and how to hack and remix it for your own projects. Please be sure to follow the links to the relevant sections for more information.

## [Remixing Pi-Dash for your projects](remixing-pi-dash.md)

All the hardware and software for Pi-Dash was created with hacking and remixing in mind: the case design can be made from different materials, or refactored entirely; the electronics can be adapted to use whatever components you have available;and the software is written in a high level language (Python) with optional bash scripts that are easy to modify.
